                <p>Jaime Zepeda was born in Chicago on November 17, 1993. He lived the majority of his life in the city
                    but
                    eventually branched out to Winona Minnesota for his freshman year of college. He soon realized the
                    city
                    is home, so he came back to Chicago to then graduate from Roosevelt University with a Bachelors
                    degree
                    in Computer Science. </p>
                <p>
                    He is taking the next steps in the broad Computer Science field by being enrolled in Northwestern’s
                    Coding Bootcamp. He feels with the skills he has learned and the knowledge he will gain, will help
                    guide
                    him to a career full of opportunities within the Computer Sciences industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jaime has always been a team player. Playing soccer his entire life, he grew to realize either
                    playing,
                    working, and being in a team environment is what is best for him to succeed. Teams can accomplish
                    goals
                    together more sufficiently then simply by yourself. He does miss being on a competitive soccer team
                    but
                    does know he can take that competitiveness and team effort to the workforce and strive for success.
